This example program provides:

* A Java class for the Index page (index.html).
* 6x Java classes for 6 pages. Additional pages can be added by adding additional classes.
* JDBCConnection Java class, that uses the CTG Database. This class contains one method to return all LGAs contained in the Database.
* Examples CSS (```common.css```) file in the resources directory.
* Example image (```logo.png```) file in the resources directory with where to locate any images you want on your website
* Starting database:
    * ```homelessness.db``` - contains a starting database for you based on the example Homelessness ER Model.
* Optional helper program (``HomelessProcessCSV.java``) that shows an example of how to load the SQLite database by using Java to read the CSV files and JDBC insert statements to update the CTG SQLite database.
* Optional helper SQL files (```homelessness_create_tables.sql```) that creates two tables (```LGA``` and ```HomelessGroup```) based on the example Homelessness ER Model.

# Building & Running the code
There are two places code can be run from
1. The **main** web server program
2. the **optional** helper program to use JDBC to load your SQLite database from the CSVs using Java

## Running the Main web server
You can run the main webserver program similar to the project workshop activities
1. Open this project within VSCode
2. Allow VSCode to read the pom.xml file
 - Allow the popups to run and "say yes" to VSCode configuring the build
 - Allow VSCode to download the required Java libraries
3. To Build & Run
 - Open the ``src/main/java/app/App.java`` source file, and select "Run" from the pop-up above the main function
4. Go to: http://localhost:7001
